Q1: Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum.

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    int a,b;
    printf("Enter the first No. :");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Enter the Second  No. :");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    printf("The Sum of First and Second No. is : %d",a+b);

    return 0;
}

Q2. Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    int a,b;
    printf("Enter the first No. :");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Enter the Second  No. :");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    printf("The Sum of First and Second No. is : %d \n",a+b);
    printf("The Differenc of First and Second No. is : %d \n",a-b);
    printf("The Product of First and Second No. is : %d \n",a*b);
    printf("The Quotient of First and Second No. is : %d \n",a/b);


    
    return 0;
}
